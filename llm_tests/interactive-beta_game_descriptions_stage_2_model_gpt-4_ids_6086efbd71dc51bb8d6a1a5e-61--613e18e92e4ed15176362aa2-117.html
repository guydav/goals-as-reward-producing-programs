If Preference 1 is satisfied with three different blue pyramid blocks, the player gets an additional 100 points. The player also gets 10 points for every different object used to satisfy Preference 2. If Preference 2 is satisfied with three different objects, the player gets an additional 100 points.</td></tr><br></tbody>
