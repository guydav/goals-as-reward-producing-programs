You also get 1 point for each stack where a cube block is on top of a tall rectangular block, which is on top of another cube block, with an additional cube block on top of the tall rectangular block, provided the bottom cube block is the same type as the tall rectangular block. Additionally, you get 1 point for each stack where a tall rectangular block is on top of a cube block, which is on top of another cube block, and the top cube block is the same type as a third cube block. Your final score is the sum of points from these three configurations.</td></tr><br><tr><td><pre><code>(:constraints<br>  (and<br>    (preference preference0<br>      (exists (?v0 - cube_block ?v1 - cube_block ?v2 - tall_rectangular_block ?v3 - cube_block)<br>        (at-end<br>          (and<br>            (on ?v3 ?v0)<br>            (on ?v3 ?v2)<br>            (on ?v3 ?v1)<br>         )<br>       )<br>     )<br>   )<br>    (preference preference1<br>      (exists (?v0 - cube_block ?v1 - cube_block ?v2 - tall_rectangular_block ?v3 - cube_block)<br>        (at-end<br>          (and<br>            (on ?v2 ?v0)<br>            (on ?v1 ?v2)<br>            (on ?v2 ?v3)<br>            (same_type ?v1 ?v2)<br>         )<br>       )<br>     )<br>   )<br>    (preference preference2<br>      (exists (?v0 - cube_block ?v1 - cube_block ?v2 - tall_rectangular_block ?v3 - cube_block)<br>        (at-end<br>          (and<br>            (on ?v3 ?v2)<br>            (on ?v0 ?v3)<br>            (same_type ?v3 ?v1)<br>         )<br>       )<br>     )<br>   )<br> )<br>)</code></pre></td><td>The preferences of the game are:<br><br>-----Preference 1-----<br>    The variables required by this preference are:<br>    -?v0, ?v1, and ?v3 of type cube_block<br>    -?v2 of type tall_rectangular_block<br><br>    This preference is satisfied when:<br>    - in the final game state, (?v0 is on ?v3), (?v2 is on ?v3), and (?v1 is on ?v3)<br><br>-----Preference 2-----<br>    The variables required by this preference are:<br>    -?v0, ?v1, and ?v3 of type cube_block<br>    -?v2 of type tall_rectangular_block<br><br>    This preference is satisfied when:<br>    - in the final game state, (?v0 is on ?v2), (?v2 is on ?v1), (?v3 is on ?v2), and (?v1 is of the same type as ?v2)<br><br>-----Preference 3-----<br>    The variables required by this preference are:<br>    -?v0, ?v1, and ?v3 of type cube_block<br>    -?v2 of type tall_rectangular_block<br><br>    This preference is satisfied when:<br>    - in the final game state, (?v2 is on ?v3), (?v3 is on ?v0), and (?v3 is of the same type as ?v1)</td><td>The preferences of the game are:<br><br>-----Preference 1-----<br>This preference is satisfied when:<br>-at the end of the game, one cube block is on top of another cube block, and a tall rectangular block is also on that same cube block<br><br>-----Preference 2-----<br>This preference is satisfied when:<br>-at the end of the game, a cube block is on top of a tall rectangular block, which is on top of another cube block, and another cube block is on top of the tall rectangular block.
