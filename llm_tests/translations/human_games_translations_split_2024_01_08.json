Position a curved wooden ramp adjacent to the front of the desk and a hexagonal bin with its front side adjacent to the back of the ramp, maintaining their placement throughout the game.\n\nGameplay: While next to the bed, throw golfballs, dodgeballs, triangle blocks, or pyramid blocks aiming for them to either land inside a hexagonal bin or touch a desktop or laptop. Additionally, throw golfballs so they touch the curved wooden ramp before landing in the hexagonal bin.\n\nScoring: Earn 1 point for each triangle block, 2 points for each pyramid block or dodgeball, and 3 points for each golfball that lands in the hexagonal bin. Earn 6 points for each golfball that touches the curved wooden ramp and then lands in the hexagonal bin. Lose 1 point for each object that comes to rest touching a desktop or laptop. The final score is the total of these points."
