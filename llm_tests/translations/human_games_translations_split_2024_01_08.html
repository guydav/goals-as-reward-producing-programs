All blocks must either be in this building or match the type of another block within it.<br><br>Gameplay: Hold blocks without placing them inside the initial building setup. Interact with blocks by holding or moving them, ensuring they touch each other and set one in motion without holding it.<br><br>Scoring: Earn 5 points for each unique object held during the game. Gain 100 points if there is a building from the initial setup and another that is not, with no two blocks inside the setup building stacked on each other unless there are two identical blocks stacked inside the non-setup building. Lose 10 points each time a block is set in motion after touching another block.          </td></tr><br><tr><td><pre><code>(:constraints<br>  (and<br>    (preference gameBlockFound<br>      (exists (?l

Specifically, the yellow pyramid block should be closest to the bin, followed by the red one at a greater distance, and finally, the blue pyramid block should be the farthest from the hexagonal bin. Make sure these distances are maintained throughout the game.</td><td>Setup: Place a flat block on the rug and ensure it remains there for the entire game. Position every pyramid block on the floor and arrange three pyramid blocks of different colors—yellow, red, and blue—in increasing distances from a hexagonal bin, with the yellow block being the closest and the blue block being the farthest.<br><br>Gameplay: Hold a dodgeball while standing next to a pyramid block and throw it into the hexagonal bin. Additionally, incorporate a flat block and a cube block into a building as part of the setup.<br><br>Scoring: Earn 10 points for each successful throw of the dodgeball into the bin with the yellow pyramid block, 25 points with the red pyramid block, and 50 points with the blue pyramid block. Also, gain 10 points for each different object used to satisfy the condition of having a flat block and a cube block inside a building.

Position a curved wooden ramp adjacent to the front of the desk and a hexagonal bin with its front side adjacent to the back of the ramp, maintaining their placement throughout the game.<br><br>Gameplay: While next to the bed, throw golfballs, dodgeballs, triangle blocks, or pyramid blocks aiming for them to either land inside a hexagonal bin or touch a desktop or laptop. Additionally, throw golfballs so they touch the curved wooden ramp before landing in the hexagonal bin.<br><br>Scoring: Earn 1 point for each triangle block, 2 points for each pyramid block or dodgeball, and 3 points for each golfball that lands in the hexagonal bin. Earn 6 points for each golfball that touches the curved wooden ramp and then lands in the hexagonal bin. Lose 1 point for each object that comes to rest touching a desktop or laptop. The final score is the total of these points.          </td></tr><br><tr><td><pre><code>(:constraints<br>  (and<br>    (forall (?o - (either golfball dodgeball triangle_block pyramid_block))<br>
