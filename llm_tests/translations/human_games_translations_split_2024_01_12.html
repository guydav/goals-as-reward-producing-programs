Also, every pyramid block should be placed on the floor. In addition, arrange a hexagonal bin and three pyramid blocks of different colors—blue, red, and yellow—in such a way that the red pyramid block is farther from the hexagonal bin than the yellow one, and the blue pyramid block is even farther from the bin than the red one. Make sure these objects stay in this arrangement for the duration of the game.      </td><td>Setup: Place a flat block on the rug and ensure it remains there throughout the game. Also, place every pyramid block on the floor. Arrange a hexagonal bin and three pyramid blocks of different colors—blue, red, and yellow—so that the red pyramid block is farther from the hexagonal bin than the yellow one, and the blue pyramid block is the farthest from the bin. Ensure these objects stay in this arrangement for the duration of the game.<br><br>Gameplay: Hold a dodgeball while standing next to a pyramid block, throw the dodgeball, and try to get it to land inside the hexagonal bin. Additionally, build structures that include the flat block used in the setup and a cube block.<br><br>Scoring: You earn 10 points for each successful throw into the bin from next to the yellow pyramid block, 25 points for throws from next to the red pyramid block, and 50 points for throws from next to the blue pyramid block. You also earn 10 points for each different object used in building structures that include the flat block and a cube block.

Ensure no chair is directly in front of the desk throughout the game. Position a curved wooden ramp with its front adjacent to the front of the desk and a hexagonal bin with its front facing the back of the ramp. Keep these items in place for the duration of the game.<br><br>Gameplay: While standing next to the bed, throw golfballs, dodgeballs, triangle blocks, or pyramid blocks so that they either land inside a hexagonal bin or touch a desktop or laptop computer. If throwing a golfball, it must also touch the curved wooden ramp before landing in the bin.<br><br>Scoring: Earn points based on the objects thrown into the hexagonal bin: 1 point for each triangle block, 2 points for each pyramid block or dodgeball, and 3 points for each golfball. Earn 6 points for each golfball that touches the ramp before landing in the bin. Lose 1 point for each object that touches a computer.</td></tr><br><tr><td><pre><code>(:constraints<br>  (and<br>    (forall (?o - (either golfball dodgeball triangle_block pyramid_block))<br>

Make sure that at some point, the teddy bear is on the chair. Throughout the entire game, the triangular ramp should be near the center of the room, the chair should be right in front of the ramp, and the chair should be positioned between the hexagonal bin and the ramp. Also, any ball should be placed near the hexagonal bin and remain there for the duration of the game.                      </td><td>Setup: Place a chair, a hexagonal bin, a teddy bear, and a triangular ramp in the room. The teddy bear should be on the chair at some point. Keep the triangular ramp near the center of the room, with the chair in front of it, positioned between the ramp and the hexagonal bin. Any ball should be placed near the hexagonal bin and stay there throughout the game.<br><br>Gameplay: Pick up the teddy bear from the chair and throw it so that it either lands inside the hexagonal bin or touches a ball.<br><br>Scoring: You get 5 points for every time the teddy bear lands in the hexagonal bin and 1 point for every time it touches a ball.</td></tr><br><tr><td><pre><code>(:constraints<br>  (and<br>    (preference teddyBearLandsInBin<br>      (exists (?t - teddy_bear ?h - hexagonal_bin ?c - chair)<br>        (then<br>
