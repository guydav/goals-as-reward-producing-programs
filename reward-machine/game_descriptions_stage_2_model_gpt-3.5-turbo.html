Place another block on the right side of the bin, with the last block on top of it.</td></tr><br><tr><td><pre><code>(:constraints<br>  (and<br>    (preference rollBallToBin<br>      (exists (?d - dodgeball ?r - curved_wooden_ramp ?h - hexagonal_bin)<br>        (then<br>          (once (agent_holds ?d))<br>          (hold-while (and (not (agent_holds ?d)) (in_motion ?d)) (on ?r ?d))<br>          (once (and (in ?h ?d) (not (in_motion ?d))))<br>       )<br>     )<br>   )<br> )<br>)</code></pre>                                                     </td><td>The preferences of the game are:<br><br>-----Preference 1-----<br>    The variables required by this preference are:<br>    -?r of type curved_wooden_ramp<br>    -?d of type dodgeball<br>    -?h of type hexagonal_bin<br><br>    This preference is satisfied when:<br>    - first, there is a state where the agent is holding ?d<br>    - next, there is a sequence of one or more states where (it's not the case that the agent is holding ?d) and (?d is in motion) Additionally, during this sequence there is a state where (?d is on ?r) (in that order).<br>    - finally, there is a state where (?d is inside of ?h) and (it's not the case that ?d is in motion)                                                                                                    </td><td>The preferences of the game are:<br><br>-----Preference 1-----<br>This preference is satisfied when:<br>- first, the agent picks up a dodgeball<br>- next, the agent throws the dodgeball, causing it to be in motion<br>- during this sequence, the dodgeball lands on a curved wooden ramp<br>- finally, the dodgeball ends up inside of the hexagonal bin and stops moving                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </td></tr><br><tr><td>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </td><td>                                                                                                   </td><td>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td></tr><br><tr><td><pre><code>(:scoring<br>  (count rollBallToBin)<br>)</code></pre>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </td><td>At the end of the game, the player's score is the number of times 'Preference 1' has been satisfied</td><td>At the end of the game, the player's score is equal to the number of times 'Preference 1' has been satisfied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </td></tr><br></tbody>

They get 6 points for each time 'Preference 1' is satisfied with a dodgeball in a hexagonal bin, 5 points for each time 'Preference 1' is satisfied with a beachball in a hexagonal bin, 4 points for each time 'Preference 1' is satisfied with a basketball in a hexagonal bin, 5 points for each time 'Preference 1' is satisfied with a dodgeball in a doggie bed, 4 points for each time 'Preference 1' is satisfied with a beachball in a doggie bed, and 3 points for each time 'Preference 1' is satisfied with a basketball in a doggie bed. Additionally, they get 5 points for each time 'Preference 2' is satisfied with a dodgeball, 4 points for each time 'Preference 2' is satisfied with a beachball, and 3 points for each time 'Preference 2' is satisfied with a basketball. The player's final score is the sum of all these points.</td></tr><br></tbody>
