In my head, I sometimes feel that an equation is better at describing a situation than literal words. And so it was not clear from the instructions whether an algebraic equation could fit the definition of a word. Also, in the design, it was not clear whether there was a door in the corner that was not visible in the images. I felt it was possible the two glass panes would be a doorway to the bedroom, but it seemed far more likely the door was in the unknown corner. Several game prompts made reference to a door and it was not clear from the visible environment where that was located. This was important when the instructions called for the hexbin to be placed near the door, and an advantage could be gained by positioning the bin relative to the room corner. But the corner would not be a valid item unless there was also a door near the corner. ",

I was quite confident that I submitted the same response answers on my second attempt on the quiz as I did on the first, but I am not more than 75% confident in this. I am almost entirely that a majority of my answers were the same, but I was navigating with my keyboard and it is possible a response was inadvertently switched. I say this only because I feel there is a small chance the quiz might be defective and incorrectly requires a second attempt. ",
        "strategy": "This is easiest on a point-by-point basis. For the re-explaining, I tried not to fill in the gaps with assumptions, but I felt that there were certain instances where an assumption was necessary to understand the game and therefore a leap of faith was a necessity. An example of this would be in matching the block types between cubes and rectangles. The type was a core requirement of the point system and therefore essential to the game execution. I felt that it was impossible to imagine obtaining points without creating an understanding of what was meant by the block type. But for the most part, I tried to break the descriptions down to explicitly define how points are awarded and the conditions that certain points can be modified through a bonus outcome. If there were limitations, I tried to describe those separately from the points, unless the limitations were unique only to one point method, and then I tried to tie the limitations directly into my point awarding explanation. \n\nFor human-like/machine-like, I considered whether the task seemed like it could be a reasonable product of imagination. Or a simple enough instruction set that it could keep young children occupied for a short while. I had a more difficult time with the games that seemed more extreme. For example, gaining one point for each item on top of the bed. In this, I could see a competitive side from the tetris perspective. It also seemed quite risk in a realisticly virtual setting in that the room contained computer equipment, though I understand this was not a game object, but it was difficult to put out of mind. I felt that the item I most needed in this setup, was the Terminal details, but these were not given. I feel that if a reasonably difficult time limit was set, then it would be human-like. But if the event was open, then the outcome would be one such that a maximum score would be too easily achieved. Requiring only the effort to relocate all moveable items. In summary, I felt that it was more machine like when the outcome was less competitive in a relocation action, or when the mental demand far exceeded the physical demand (such as in the logic block stacking level).\n\nThe more mentally complicated tasks would be more enjoyable to observe because I feel it would allow for an opportunity to observation to better understand the other player. With the more physical competitions, it is less interesting and more of a matter of patience.",
