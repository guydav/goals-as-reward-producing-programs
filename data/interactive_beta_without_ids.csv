You can play it safe and use less blocks, but for less points, or a higher tower for more points. When you have built as high as you dare, you will place yourself on the far side of the room with the red dodgeball. Then, you will throw the ball at the tower and try to knock down as many blocks as you can.","To score my game, you will get 1 point for each block you use to build the tower. If your tower falls over while building you will get -1 points. Additionally, you will get 1 point for each block you manage to knock over with the dodgeball in phase 2.",2,5,6,"It was a lot more difficult to stack the blocks than I thought. I would change the rule that you lose if the tower falls, to you getting -1 point every time it falls instead.","Since you were very much limited by the objects in the room, as well as a fairly limited control scheme, I tried to do something simple and easy to score. Using the building blocks to build a tower is a very simple idea, though it's a bit more challenging to do in the game than in real life. Once I had the idea of using more blocks to build higher = more points, I also wanted something to punish you if you built to greedy and to high. Thus, I first just made a rule that made you lose if your tower fell over while building. Playing the game myself however, I found it rather hard using the games physics to stack a stable tower, so I changed the rule to give -1 points every time your tower fell instead. Finally, once your tower was built, it's always fun to knock stuff over. So, using the red dodgeball, I gave bonus points for each block you managed to knock over in a single throw.",The frame rate could get low at times., It would have been nice to be able to simply drop an item you've picked up instead of just throwing it.

1st one is a simple basketball game using the bin as a basket and the dodgeballs as bastketballs put the bin on one end of the room or on the bed (for a higher difficulty) and use the other end of the room as a marker from where you throw.
2nd You can setup a Mini Golf course using the Ramps, Pyramids and different building blocks to setup a course the Bridges would be used as goals.
3rd requires a setup from a different Person. One Person hides small object inside the room (like the cellhpone, Key, Credit Card, Cd and so on) and then you have to find all objects in a given time limit. ","1. Basketball
2. Mini Golf
3. ""hide and seek""","1. 10 tries 1 Point if the ball lands in the Bin 3 Points if it lands in the Bin without touching the floor before.
2. Number of tries to hit the goal (just like regular golf Par would be determined by the difficulty of the course)
3. Number of objects found with a difficulty multiplier for the Time limit 5 minutes = 1 Point per Object 3 miutes = 2 Points 90 seconds = 3 Points",1,The Basketball game is pretty easy. Mini golf is very difficult because of the weird physics engine used. And hide and seek depends on the places where things are hidden.,5,I built the basketball game (and i made a mistake when predicting my score i thought i can continue writing in the next line by pressing shift+enter but i continued the survey) and i should have built it the other way round so placing then bin next to the desk. Because the edge of the carpet can stop your dodge balls. ,First i saw all the different building blocks and thought of a Jenga like game where u had to place blocks onto another without them falling over but the physics engine is really bad and the controls are too sensitive. Then i tried the mini golf thing i described but noticed a lot of problems with the golf balls bouncing all over the place but not rolling. Then i settled for the Basketball game because the dodge balls gave me the least amount of trouble. ,I think my pc is too powerful for this and i think the physics are based on FPS. So i have to move every object extra carefully. If you are holding an object it shouldn't collide with everything i knocked of the PC a dozen times trying to move a pen. And you cant pick up the pc so it is stuck on the ground and you have to reset the room really annoying. But on the other hand objects will just clip through walls. When trying to hide things behind a blinder most of the time they clipped through the window disappearing into the void. Then i tried hiding the credit card und a block on the shelf. Everytime the block touches the card it clips through the shelf. ,The Robot you control looks like straight out of a cheap horror movie maybe change the model :D,No
